## FAQ

### You can already set the font in Obsidian's settings. When is this useful?

This CSS snippet is useful when:

1. You use [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) to sync settings (notably CSS snippets) across multiple devices; and
2. You want to ensure the same font is displayed correctly regardless of which fonts are actually installed on your devices.

### How can I change the font to something else?

A tool such as https://transfonter.org can be used to Base64 encode a font. Base64 encoding the font produces a CSS file where the font data is embedded within a `@font-face` definition.

The `@font-face` definition in [jetbrains-mono-font-monospace-theme.css](jetbrains-mono-font-monospace-theme.css) needs to be replaced with your new definition and the `--font-monospace-theme` definition in the `body` element needs to be updated:

```css
body {
    --font-monospace-theme: 'NEW FONT NAME';
}
```

### How can I have this also change the text font and the interface font?

Obsidian has a few [intrinsic site font CSS variables](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Publish/Site+fonts) including `--font-monospace-theme`. New definitions for `--font-text-theme` and `--font-interface-theme` need to be included in the `body` element of [jetbrains-mono-font-monospace-theme.css](jetbrains-mono-font-monospace-theme.css):

```css
body {
    --font-text-theme: 'JetBrains Mono';
    --font-monospace-theme: 'JetBrains Mono';
    --font-interface-theme: 'JetBrains Mono';
}
```
